## How to run and test project

### Run

1. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` from the root folder to install all packages
2. Find the [.env](./backend/.env) file and replace the _DATABASE_URL_ local DB string with your own MongoDB connection string
3. Create a new collection in MongoDB and import data from the [mongodb.json](./extra/mongodb.json) file
4. Run `npm run devstart` or `yarn devstart` from root folder to start the server with nodemon

### Test

1. Import data from the [postman.json](./extra/postman.json) file into Postman
2. **Run all requests in collection - in order**
3. Tests marked with üîë require you to paste in JWT from any authorized user
4. Tests marked with üë®‚Äçüè´ require you to paste in JWT from an authorized user with teacher role

\*_Feel free to also run your own tests, I didn't include every possible option._

#### Comments

_\*I chose to have a top level /api and a sublevel /users, so that it would be possible to add other "collections" later_

_\*\* Not the best solution to send temporary passwords in plain-text, in a real app the customer would probably be sent an e-mail. But for the sake of having some sort of functionality for the "Forgot password"-section of the front-end, I decided to do it this way._
