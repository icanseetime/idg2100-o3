## How to run and test project

### Run

1. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` from **the backend folder** to install all packages
2. Create a new collection in MongoDB and import data from the [mongodb.json](./extra/mongodb.json) file
3. Find the [.env](./backend/.env) file and replace the _DATABASE_URL_ local DB string with your own MongoDB connection string
4. Run `npm run devstart` or `yarn devstart` from **the backend folder** to start the server with nodemon

### Test

1. Import collection from the [postman.json](./extra/postman.json) file into Postman
2. Run all requests in collection - preferrably in order
3. Requests marked with üîë requires a JWT in the form of a Bearer token from any authorized user in the Authorization tab
4. Requests marked with üë®‚Äçüè´ requires a JWT from an authorized user with teacher role

\*_Feel free to also run your own tests, I didn't include every possible option._

#### Comments

_\*I chose to have a top level /api and a sublevel /users, so that it would be possible to add other "collections" to the API later_

_\*\* Definitely not an optimal solution to send temporary passwords in plain-text, in a real app the customer would probably be sent an e-mail where they could reset their password. But for the sake of having some sort of functionality for the "Forgot password"-section of the front-end, I decided to do it this way._

### Notes

-   I have CORS installed and set up, because I realized I needed it when I set up the backend for Oblig 2. It's not necessary for this task, but for the sake of the "API remaining completely independent" I decided to leave it there.
-   I've used the users :email instead of :\_id as identifiers on the endpoints, because it seemed easier to deal with for the client-side. In hindsight, when I realized the users should not have access to other users e-mail, it might not have been the best idea. I've left it as is, and I included both in the JWT, just in case.
-   I chose not to create separate files for the routes that teachers have access to, all users have access to etc. I kept them in the same file since the endpoints are so similar, and I wanted to keep all /users routes in the same file. Instead, I used 2 different JWT strategies, and used them as middleware on the appropriate routes.
-   There is almost no validation of passwords (like min 1 letter and 1 number) or checking of e-mail being a proper e-mail etc. I did that on the client-side in oblig2, so I made an assumption that it wasn't necessary.
